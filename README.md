# A Coffee Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
 This analysis presents an analysis of coffee sales data collected between 2019 and 2021. The dataset contains details on customer purchases, product types, roast preferences, and regional distribution. The purpose of the analysis is to uncover sales trends, identify top-performing products, and provide actionable insights that can guide strategic business decisions.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Data loading and Inspection
-  Handling missing values
-  IFS Function to standardize values
-  Vlookup Function to J
-  Data cleaning and formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA invovles exploring the Coffee sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- what is the overall sales trend overtime?
- What is the most popular coffee types and roast preferences?
- What is the customers behaviour overtime?

  ### Results
  1. The country that generates the highest revenue is the United States, which generates close to 80% of the café’s revenue.
  2. Sales show steady growth, with peaks observed during mid-year and holiday periods, reflecting seasonal demand.
  3. Customers with loyalty cards contribute significantly to repeat purchases, particularly in the U.S. market.
  4. Arabica, Liberia, and Excelsa emerge as the most purchased coffee types, showing strong consumer preference.

### Recommendations
- Focus marketing and distribution efforts on the U.S. market.
- Expand product lines for Arabica and medium roasts.
- Strengthen loyalty programs internationally to boost retention.
- Launch seasonal campaigns during mid-year and festive periods.

  ###Limitations
  I removed all zero values from the Unit price column because they would affect the accuracy of my conclusions for the analysis.
